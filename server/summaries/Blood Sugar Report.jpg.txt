This medical report presents a **blood sugar analysis for a patient named DHARMENDRA MONAPARA**.

The report shows a single blood sugar measurement without any value actually listed.  It references the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for diagnosing Diabetes Mellitus (DM) with classifications based on fasting blood sugar levels:

*   **Normal:** <100 mg/dL
*   **Pre-Diabetes:** 100-125 mg/dL
*   **Diabetes:** >= 126 mg/dL

**Crucially, the patient's actual blood sugar level is missing from the report.** Therefore, it's impossible to determine from this report whether Dharmendra Monapara has normal blood sugar, pre-diabetes, or diabetes.
